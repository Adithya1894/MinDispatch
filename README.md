Chat Simulation Machines
========================

There are currently two working machines:

- `ChatEventMachine` A naive chat simulation (easiest to understand)
- `StatefulChatEventMachine` A pattern-oriented approach to chat simulation

The construction of each machine, in order, are described at [my
blog](http://www.giocc.com).
